## Site Overview:
Tutoring website that assists with the pairing of students and tutors for various topics. The website is based around a student/tutor's login page, where they can create/join classes.  
An admin page is available to allow CRUD actions on database tables that are otherwise inaccessible.
  
## Frameworks/Libraries:
The required libraries are list in the requirement.txt file. <br>
The website is built using the Flask framework, which employs Jinja2 templating. We also shaped the site's aesthetic using Bootstrap, and used the SQLAlchemy toolkit for backend tasks.

## Database Specifics:
The images below are the Schema and ERD for our site's database:

<br> <br>
The following are the project specifications that guided our site design:
* The database should have at least 4 entities and at least 4 relationships, 1 of which must be a many-to-many relationship.
* Full CRUD functionality for every entity.
* Easy to navigate and aesthetically pleasing front end for the website.
